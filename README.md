# 3rd Attempt is LSTM with no data preprocessing, batch size 100

# 4th Attempt is LSTM with data preprocessing, but training set is dividing into train and test sets. So dataset is smaller

# 5th Attempt


# 6th Attempt is the best attempt using Porter Stemming Technique

# 7th Attempt, I just tried using bidirectional LSTM

# 8th Attempt is LSTM with no data preprocessing

# 9th Attempt is LSTM with Snowball Stemming Technique

# 10th Attempt is LSTM with Lancaster Stemming Technique
